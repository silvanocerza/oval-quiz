Oval quiz
=========

These are my answers to the quiz.

1. You can find the code on the `fizzbuzz` folder
2. Most of the times I find myself explaining technical things to my girlfriend, she's studying a completely different field so I use layman terms that anyone could understand even if doesn't know much about computers. For example I remember that time I had to explain what HTTPS and TLS are and why they're useful. I figured two persons, Alice and Bob, that want to send messages secretly between themselves without being spied but first they must decide a secret key to encode their messages. So Alice gets a box, containing the secret key, locked with a unique lock that only her has a key to open and sends it to Bob, he adds his own lock and sends it back to Alice, Alice in turn removes her lock and send it back to Bob. Now Bob removes his lock and can get to the secret key and read it, now both parties know it and can send encoded messages back and forth without using two separate locks so it's much faster. I've used this explanation of TLS some times and it never failed.
3. In folder `recursive_factorial`
4. The average time complexity is O(n log n), worst case is O(n<sup>2</sup>)
5. I don't like the handling of requirements and environments in Python, there are lots of tools all trying to accomplish the same thing with various degrees of success, Pipenv is certainly good but I believe the Python Foundation should enforce one, and only one, way of doing that. For example I really like the way Rust handles its requirements with Cargo, it comes directly bundled with language installation, you're free to use another but the official way is Cargo.
6. In folder `java_begone`
7. In folder `combinations`
