Oval quiz
=========

These are my answers to the quiz.

1. You can find the code on the `fizzbuzz` folder
2.
3. In folder `recursive_factorial`
4. The average time complexity is O(n log n), worst case is O(n<sup>2</sup>)
5. I don't like the handling of requirements and environments in Python, there are lots of tools all trying to accomplish the same thing with various degrees of success, Pipenv is certainly good but I believe the Python Foundation should enforce one, and only one, way of doing that. For example I really like the way Rust handles its requirements with Cargo, it comes directly bundled with language installation, you're free to use another but the official way is Cargo.
6. In folder `java_begone`
